        <h2>Chapter 1: The idea</h2>
        <p> "Everything begins with an idea." </p> <br>
        <p>These page your currently surfing is made by yours Ian himself.</p>
        <p>Why do you ask, why would I make a page like this? The answer is; </p>
        <p>I think it would be great to express and make it as a gift.</p>
        <p>To give you some details I'm currently hosting it in my github page, <br>
           which you can see <br> <br>in the link (.github.io thingy)<br><br> 
           Also sorry if the page looks kinda lame to be honest I just try to make a new theme but <br>
            yeah for me it kinda look lame but let just ignore it... So basically this <br>
            idiot guy wants to give you this simple page as a gift (well except from the <br> boquet and necklace and other stuff which we will talk about later).

            <h2>Chapter 2: The Preparation</h2>

            <br> 

            <p>
                Many things are needed to be reconsidered in making this page <br> first
                of all the time I need to spend for this project <br> sadly it literally crashes when the time School works kinda little bit <br> making my time more consumed due to the fact my Profs are starting to <br> to give us heavy task that causes me to make a timesched <br>(which I dont have and dont follow it since I'm a lazy lame guy). <br> And yeah I kinda crashes my
                shed but it doesn't matter since I'm enjoying <br> making this page and making me again to grasp my knowledge in html and css <br> but I kinda agree that the last project I made is kinda good compare to this one...

                <br> <br> 

                Trying to learn css and html again is kinda hectic, I have to <br>  remember what does it do and to learn new things: <br> <br>
                <a href="day one lol.png" data-lightbox="my gallery" data-title=""><img class="screenshotone" src="day one lol.png" alt="a screenshot of code"></a> <br> <br>

                This is the screenshot of me making and struggling in making a nav bar <br> (I just watching in tutorials throughout YouTube)
                
                <br>
                
                But anyways I tried to make the page as quirky in some standpoint. <br> Sadly I'm not skillful enough to put some advanced css or javascript in the code <br> because learning it is not so easy and I don't have any <br> prior knowledge...

                <h2>Chapter 3: Hindrances and Outcome</h2> <br>

                <p>
                    How can I say it... Comapared to the past mini projects <br>
                    I've made, I could say this is a lot more simplistic and <br>
                    has minimalistic design (having some ideas with my past mini projects too). <br><br>
                    I came up with some hurdles and struggles while making this <br> smol present for you. Main problem is the time,
                    as you can tell I just make <br> this web from scratch for atleast 1-2 weeks only. With that short time frame <br> and the fact re graping my knowledge in making html css website makes it kinda hard too <br> but that hardships came into a great outcome. I can definetly say I'm proud of what I've made <br> even though I just try to make this with the help of YouTube <br> which for me kinda lacks some speciality at some point <br> but yeah! Here you go! 

                    <br><br>

                    Just enjoy surfing in this simple web I made for you Claire. <br> I hope your having a great day right now. <br> I'm sorry for not going there because of the time sched and other things <br> I need to consider before going in Las Pi√±as. I will try to make it up to you next time okay? <br> <br>

                    Enjoy the rest of your day My Queen <br>
                    Happy Happy Happy Birthday <3
